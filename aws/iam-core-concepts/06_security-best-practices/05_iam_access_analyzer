# 🔍 IAM Access Analyzer

IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify the **resources in your account that are shared with an external entity** (like another AWS account, AWS service, or public access).

---

## ✅ What is IAM Access Analyzer?

It continuously monitors resource policies (S3 buckets, IAM roles, KMS keys, etc.) and flags:
- Publicly accessible resources
- Cross-account access
- Third-party services accessing your resources

---

## 🎯 Why Use It?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Security visibility | Know which resources are accessible externally |
| Prevent misconfigurations | Detect and fix risky permissions |
| Audit readiness | Great for compliance & access reviews |

## 🧪 How to Use It

### 📌 GUI (AWS Console):

1. Go to **IAM Console → Access Analyzer**
2. Click **"Create Analyzer"**
3. Give it a name, select your **Region and account type**
4. After it's created, it will scan and show findings.

### 📌 CLI:

```bash
# Create Analyzer
aws accessanalyzer create-analyzer --analyzer-name my-analyzer --type ACCOUNT

# List Findings
aws accessanalyzer list-findings

# Show finding details
aws accessanalyzer get-finding --id <finding-id>
```

## 📁 What Access Analyzer Detects

- IAM roles with trust policies allowing external principals
- S3 buckets with public or cross-account access
- KMS keys shared with another AWS account
- Secrets shared externally

---

## 🔒 Best Practices

- Create analyzer per region
- Review findings regularly
- Automate actions on risky findings using Lambda or SNS
- Integrate with AWS Config for compliance

---

## 📌 Real-time Project Use

In your **Disaster Management project**, you can:
- Ensure S3 buckets (citizen data) aren't public
- Audit IAM roles for unintended third-party access
- Automatically notify your team via SNS if a risky role is created
