# IAM Security Best Practices – Overview

## 🔐 What is IAM Security?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) Security in AWS refers to the set of strategies, tools, and practices used to ensure that **only authorized users and resources** have access to specific AWS services and actions — nothing more, nothing less.

---

## 🧠 Why IAM Security Matters?

- AWS operates on a **shared responsibility model** — AWS secures the infrastructure, but **you are responsible for securing your cloud usage**.
- **Improper IAM configurations** (e.g., overly permissive policies, use of root account, exposed access keys) are top causes of **cloud breaches**.
- Security = Trust. For organizations, weak IAM puts their **entire infrastructure, customer data, and brand reputation at risk**.

## 🚨 Common Security Risks in IAM

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔓 Use of Root Account | Full access; should never be used for daily tasks. |
| 🧾 Inline Policies | Hard to manage and audit compared to managed policies. |
| ❗Over-Permissive Roles/Policies | "Action: *" allows unnecessary access. |
| 🔑 Hardcoded Access Keys | Easy attack vector if leaked on GitHub or exposed. |
| 📊 No Monitoring | No way to detect unauthorized or suspicious access. |

## 🛡️ AWS’s "Security First" Principle

Amazon’s **Well-Architected Framework** promotes security as a **pillar of cloud design**. IAM plays a core role in implementing the following:

- **Least privilege access**
- **Separation of duties**
- **Password policies & MFA enforcement**
- **Access audits & logging**
- **Cross-account trust boundaries**

## 📌 Conclusion
IAM Security isn’t a one-time task — it’s a **continuous practice**. Every role, user, and policy must be crafted, audited, and evolved with **security as the foundation**.
