# ✅ IAM Policy Best Practices

Following best practices while designing IAM policies is critical for security, scalability, and maintainability. Here’s a complete guide to help you follow AWS-recommended practices.

---

## 🔐 1. Follow Least Privilege Principle

- **What**: Only grant permissions the user absolutely needs.
- **Why**: Reduces the blast radius in case of a breach.
- **How**: Start with read-only policies, then expand as needed.

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:GetObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
}
```

---

## 🧩 2. Use Managed Policies for Reusability

- Prefer **Customer Managed Policies** over **Inline**.
- AWS **Managed Policies** can help you get started quickly.
- Easily update and attach policies to multiple identities.

---

## 🧪 3. Always Test with IAM Policy Simulator

- Validate permissions before applying them in production.
- Helps debug deny errors and policy behavior.

## 👨‍👩‍👧 4. Use IAM Groups Instead of Assigning Permissions Individually

- Assign users to groups like `Admins`, `Developers`, etc.
- Easier to manage permissions across the team.

---

## 🧾 5. Define Specific Resources

- Avoid using `"Resource": "*"` unless absolutely necessary.
- Define specific ARNs for tighter control.

---

## 📍 6. Use Conditions to Add Context

- Add extra layers of security with `Condition` blocks.
- Examples: Restrict access by IP, VPC, MFA, etc.

```json
"Condition": {
  "Bool": {
    "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"
  }
}
```

---

## 🚫 7. Avoid Using Inline Policies

- Difficult to manage and audit.
- Hard to reuse across entities.
- Prefer **Managed Policies**.

---

## 🕵️ 8. Regularly Audit IAM Policies

- Use tools like:
  - IAM Access Analyzer
  - CloudTrail logs
  - AWS Config for compliance

---

## 📊 9. Use Access Levels (Read/Write/Admin) in Naming Convention

Example:
- `EC2_ReadOnly_Policy`
- `S3_Admin_Access`

Helps in quick understanding and classification.

---

## 🧼 10. Clean Up Unused Policies

- Remove old, unused policies and stale permissions regularly.

---

## 🔐 11. Use Permission Boundaries (Advanced)

- Restrict how much access IAM roles or users can delegate.
- Great for teams that need to enforce boundaries within large orgs.
