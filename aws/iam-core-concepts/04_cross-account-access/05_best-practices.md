## üìÑ*IAM Cross-Account Access Best Practices*

Cross-account access can be a powerful tool, but **misconfigurations can lead to serious security risks**. Here's a list of battle-tested best practices to follow during implementation:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Principle of Least Privilege**

- **Only allow necessary permissions** to the IAM Role in the trusting account.
- Use **custom policies** instead of overly permissive managed ones like `AdministratorAccess`.

üß† _"Never give more permissions than required."_

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Limit Trust to Specific Roles or Users**

In your **trust policy**, instead of allowing `root` access to all users from Account B:

‚ùå Bad Practice:
```json
"Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Account-B-ID>:root" }
```

‚úÖ Good Practice:
```json
"Principal": {
  "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Account-B-ID>:user/cross-user"
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è This restricts access to **only one user**, not all users from the account.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Enable MFA for Cross-Account Access**

Add **MFA condition** to trust policy:
```json
"Condition": {
  "Bool": { "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true" }
}
```

This enhances security, especially for high-privilege access.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Monitor All Role Assumptions Using CloudTrail**

- Track when and by whom a cross-account role is assumed.
- Look for `AssumeRole` events in CloudTrail logs.
- Set up **alarms or alerts** for unexpected cross-account usage.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Name Your Roles Clearly**

Example:
- `CrossAccountS3ReadAccessFromAccountB`
- `CrossAccountAdminFromSecurityAccount`

This improves traceability when managing dozens of roles.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Use External IDs When Working with 3rd Parties**

To prevent the **confused deputy problem**, use an `ExternalId` condition in trust policy when the other account is owned by a third party.

```json
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "sts:ExternalId": "YOUR_UNIQUE_ID"
  }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Use Session Tags to Track Users**

Use session tags when calling `assume-role`:
```bash
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<Account-A-ID>:role/CrossAccountAccessRole \
  --role-session-name tagged-session \
  --tags Key=Team,Value=DevOps
```

‚û° Helps identify "who did what" when monitoring logs.

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **Apply IAM Access Analyzer to Validate Trust Relationships**

Run IAM Access Analyzer to:
- Identify overly permissive trust policies
- Detect unintended access paths
- Fix misconfigurations before they become problems

---

### ‚úÖ 9. **Limit Role Session Duration**

Don't allow users to stay assumed forever.

Example:
```json
"MaxSessionDuration": 3600  // 1 hour
```
