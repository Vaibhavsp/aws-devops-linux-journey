# ✅ IAM Roles Best Practices


This document outlines the best practices for using AWS IAM Roles effectively and securely.

---

## 🔐 1. Use Roles Instead of Long-Term Credentials
Assign IAM roles to AWS services like EC2, Lambda, ECS instead of storing access keys in applications.

## 🔐 2. Follow Least Privilege Principle
Grant only the permissions required to perform specific actions. Avoid wildcards like `"*"` unless necessary.

## 🔐 3. Use Separate Roles per Use Case
Avoid one role doing too much. Create smaller roles tailored to specific services or teams.

## 🔐 4. Enable Logging for Role Assumptions
Use **AWS CloudTrail** to track who assumed which role, when, and from where.

## 🔐 5. Restrict Role Assumption with Conditions
Use condition blocks in the trust policy to control access by IP, MFA, tags, etc.

## 🔐 6. Use External ID for Third-Party Access
Avoid the "Confused Deputy" problem by requiring an `ExternalId` in the trust policy for third-party integrations.

## 🔐 7. Set Minimal Session Duration
Limit role session time to the shortest possible duration based on the task.

## 🔐 8. Prefer Managed Policies Over Inline
Attach reusable, managed policies instead of inline policies for better maintainability.

## 🔐 9. Review Roles Regularly
Audit and clean up unused or over-privileged roles using **IAM Access Analyzer**.

## 🔐 10. Use IAM Policy Simulator
Test role-based permissions before deploying using the AWS **Policy Simulator** tool.
