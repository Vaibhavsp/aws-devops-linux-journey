## 🧠 Real-Life Use Cases (Simplified)

- **On-Demand:** Like renting a hotel room for 1 night. Best for short tests or experiments.
- **Reserved Instance:** Pay upfront like annual rent. Great for steady, long-term usage.
- **Spot Instance:** Last-minute ticket at 90% off — but flight may get cancelled. Ideal for non-critical, restartable jobs.
- **Savings Plan:** Uber Pass for compute. Commit ₹100/hour for 1 year, use any car (instance type).
- **Dedicated Host:** Full house booked. Use your own software licenses (BYOL).
- **Dedicated Instance:** Private flat, not whole building. Shared hardware but isolated compute.
- **Capacity Reservation:** Book a restaurant table in advance for a festival crowd — ensure instance availability in AZ.

## 🧾 Memorization Hack

- **O** – On-Demand = One-time
- **R** – Reserved = Regular load
- **S** – Spot = Sudden cheap compute
- **S.P.** – Savings Plan = Smart flexibility
- **D.H.** – Dedicated Host = Full hardware control
- **D.I.** – Dedicated Instance = Isolated environment
- **C.R.** – Capacity Reservation = Calendar booking for AZ
